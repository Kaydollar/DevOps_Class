## Connecting Jenkins to our Source Code MAnagement.

* Now that we have created a freestyle project, let connect jenkins with github.

    - i. Create a new github repository called jenkins-scm with a `README.md` file

    - ii. Connect `jenkins` to `jenkins-scm` repository by pasting the repository url in the area selected below.
    Make sure your current branch is `main`

    - iii. Save configuration and run "build now" to connect jenkins to our repository

We have successfully connected jenkins with our github repository (jenkins-scm)

### Configuring¬†Build¬†Trigger

As a engineer, we need to be able to automate things and make our work easier in possible ways. We have connected "jenkins" to "jenkins-scm", but we cannot run a new build with clicking on "Build Now".
To eliminate this, we need to confire a build trigger to our jenkins job. With this, jenkins will run a new build anytime a change is made to our github repository

- i. Click "Configure" on your job and add this configurations
