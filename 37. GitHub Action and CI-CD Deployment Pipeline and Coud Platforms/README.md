# GitHub Action and CI/CD Course: Deployment Pipelines and Cloud Platforms.

## Introduction to GitHub Actions Course: Deployment and Cloud Integration.

### Lesson 1: Introduction to Deployment Pipeline

- Objectives:
    - Define and understand the stages of delpoyment pipeline.
    - Learn about different deployment strategies.

### Lesson Details:
1. Defining deployment Stages
- **Development:** Writing a testing code in a local environment
- **Integration:** Merging Code changes to a shared branch
- **Testing:** Running automated tests to ensure code Quality
- **Staging:** Deploying code to a production-like environment for final testing.
- **Production:** Releasing the final version of your code to the end user.

### Understanding Delpoyment Strategies:

- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Running two production environment, only one which serves end users at any time.
- **Canary Releases:** Rolling out changes to a small subset of users before full deployment.
- **Rolling Deployment:** Gradually replacing instances of the previous version of an application with the new version. 

### Lesson 2: Automated Relases and versioning

**Objectives**
- Automate Versioning in the CI/CD Process.
- Create and manage software releases.

**Automating Versioning in CI/CD:**
1. Semantic Versioning:
- Use semantic versioning (SemVer) for your software. It uses a three-part version number, for example, `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Resources: [Sematic Versioning](https://semver.org/) 

2. Automated Versioning with gitHub Actions:
- Implement Automated Versioning using GitHub Actions to Increment version numbers automatically based on code changes.

Example Snippet for a Versioning Script in GitHubActions:
```bash
name: Bump version and tag
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Tag
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # The checkout action checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.

      - name: Bump version and push tag
        uses: anothrNick/github-tag-action@1.26.0
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{" secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN "}}
          DEFAULT_BUMP: patch
        # This action automatically increments the patch version and tags the commit.
        # 'DEFAULT_BUMP' specifies the type of version bump (major, minor, patch).
```
This action will automatically increase the patch version and create a new tag each time changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Ceating and Managing Releases:
1. Automating releases with GitHub Actions:
- Setup GitHub Action to create a new releases whenever a new tag is pushed to the Repository.

**Example snippet to create a release**
```bash
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

jobs:
  build:
    name: Create Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        # Checks out the code in the tag that triggered the workflow.

      - name: Create Release
        id: create_release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{" secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN "}}
        with:
          tag_name: ${{" github.ref "}}
          release_name: Release ${{" github.ref "}}
          # This step creates a new release in GitHub using the tag name.
```
The `actions/create-release@v1` action is used to create a release on GitHub. It uses the tag that triggered the workflow to name and label the release. 

### Troubleshooting and Additional Resources:

- For troubleshooting GitHub Actions, the GitHub Actions Documentation is an invaluable resource.

- To resolve issues related to specific actions used in your workflow, refer to their respective repositories on GitHub or their documentation.

- For general questions and community support, the GitHub Community Forum can be a great place to seek help.

- Remember, reading through the logs generated by GitHub Actions can provide insights into what might be going wrong with your workflows.

### Lesson 3: Deploying to Cloud Platforms

**Objectives:**
- Deploy applications to popular cloud platforms using GitHub Actions.

- Configure deployment environments.

### Lesson Details:
- Detailed Guide: Deploying Applications to Cloud Platforms with GitHub Actions

- For beginners completely new to GitHub Actions and cloud deployment, it's essential to understand the process step-by-step. Here's a detailed breakdown of deploying applications to cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform using GitHub Actions:

### Step 1: Choose a Cloud Platform.

- Decide on the Cloud Platform based on your Project requirement. Each Platform (AWS, AZURE, GOOGLE CLOUD) has its own set of services and Pricing Models.
- AWS: [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Azure: [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
- GCP: [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)

### Step 2: Set-UP GitHub Action for Deployment.
1. Creating the Workflow File:
- Workflow files are YAML files storage in your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.
- Start by creating a file e.g, `deploy-to-aws.yml` in this directory.
2. Defining the Workflow
- A workflow is defined with a series of steps that run on specified events.

***Example of AWS Deployment***
```bash
name: Deploy to AWS
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  # This workflow triggers on a push to the 'main' branch.

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Specifies the runner environment.

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE.

    - name: Set up AWS credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{" secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID "}}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{" secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY "}}
        aws-region: us-west-2
      # Configures AWS credentials from GitHub secrets.

    - name: Deploy to AWS
      run: |
        # Add your deployment script here.
        # For example, using AWS CLI commands to deploy.
```
This workflow deploys your application to AWS when changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Step 3: Configuring Deployment Environments
1. Setting UP Environment VAriables and Secrets
- Store sensitive information like API Keys and Access tokens as [GITHUB SECRETS](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
- Use Environment Variables for non-sensitive configuratiom. 
2. Environment-Specific Workflow:
- Tailor your workflow for different environments (development, staging, production) by using conditions or different workflow files.

### Troubleshooting
- Review action logs in GitHub for errors during execution.
- Ensure that your cloud platform credentials are correctly set up in GitHub Secrets.
- Validate your YAML file for syntax errors using online validators like [YAML Lint.](https://www.yamllint.com/)
