# Cloud computing
Cloud computing is a paradigm where computing resources, like servers, storage, and software, are delivered over the internet instead of being hosted locally. Users can access these resources on demand, typically paying for what they use. This on-demand access allows for flexibility, scalability, and cost savings. 

* Key aspects of cloud computing:
    * **On-demand access:**

    Users can access computing resources whenever they need them, without having to wait for physical infrastructure to be set up

    * **Pay-as-you-go:**

    Users typically only pay for the resources they actually use, making it a cost-effective option. 

    * **Scalability:**

    Cloud resources can be easily scaled up or down to meet changing needs. 

    * **Flexibility:**

    Cloud computing allows for a variety of services, including software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS). 

    * **Remote storage:**

    Data and applications can be stored and accessed remotely, making them accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. 

* **Benefits of cloud computing:**
    * **Cost savings:**
    By avoiding the need for physical infrastructure, businesses can save money on hardware, software, and personnel. 

    * **Increased productivity:**
    Cloud computing can streamline workflows, improve collaboration, and make it easier for employees to work remotely. 

    * **Improved security:**
    Cloud service providers invest heavily in security infrastructure, which can result in stronger data protection than what a smaller organization could provide on their own. 

    * **Enhanced collaboration:**
    Cloud platforms often include built-in collaboration tools, making it easier for teams to work together on projects. 

    * **Global service delivery:**
    Cloud computing enables businesses to deliver services to customers anywhere in the world. 

* **Types of cloud computing models:**
    * **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**
    Provides access to basic computing resources like servers, storage, and networking. 

    * **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**
    Offers a complete platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications. 

    * **Software as a Service (SaaS):**
    Delivers software applications over the internet, often on a subscription basis. 

* **Examples of cloud services:**
    * **Amazon Web Services (AWS):**
    Amazon Web Services https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/ offers a wide range of cloud services. 

    * **Microsoft Azure:**
