# Git Version Control Basics
## Version Control is a system that tracks changes made to a set of files over time

## BENEFITS
    Tracking History

    Collaboration

    Experimentation

    Mitigating Risks

## KINDS
### Centralized Version Control
    A single server stores the entire repository and its history. 

    Example: SVN, CVS

### Distributed Version Control
    Every participating server has access to the complete repository and its history.

    Example: Git, Mercurial

### BRANCH

### COMMIT
    A snapshot of the repository at a point in time.

### MERGE
    The process of combining changes across two branches
